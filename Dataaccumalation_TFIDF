TASK 4- 

Using Hive download the cumalative titles for each of the users in the list of top 10 users from task 3.

hive>create table TopPost(owneruserid int, title string);

hive>insert into TopPost;

hive>select postsdata.owneruserid, postsdata.title from posts where userid in (select postsdata.owneruserid, sum(postsdata.score) as total_score from postsdata
    >group by postsdata.owneruserid
    >order by total_score desc
    >limit 10;);
    >GROUP BY posts.owneruserid, posts.title


hive>create table USER4883 (Title string);
hive>insert into USER4883;
hive>select title from TopPost where owneruserid=4883;
 
Similarly, for each user create table and fetch only titles, this will help to download the tables with the content as all the ttles of the particular user in the table.

HADOOP COMMAND- hadoop fs -cat /user/hive/warehouse/docs_users/* > 'filename'

Once the files are in the local system, process using python notebook to calculate TF-IDF of the top 10 terms for each of the top 10 users.
